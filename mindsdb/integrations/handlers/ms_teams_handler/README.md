The Microsoft Teams handler is initialized with the following parameters:

- `webhook_url`: a required webhook url for the Microsoft Teams channel to send messages to

## Implemented Features

- [x] Send messages to a Microsoft Teams channel via a webhook

## TODO

- [ ] Support other options for sending messages such as sections, images, actions, etc.
- [ ] Support INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE for messages table

## Example Usage

The first step is to create a database with the new `teams` engine by passing in the required `webhook_url` parameter:

~~~~sql
CREATE DATABASE teams_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'teams',
PARAMETERS = {
  "webhook_url": "https://..."
};
~~~~

Use the established connection to send messages to your Teams channel:

~~~~sql
INSERT INTO teams_datasource.messages (title, text)
VALUES ('Hello', 'World');
~~~~

Multiple messages can also be sent in a single query:

~~~~sql
INSERT INTO teams_datasource.messages (title, text)
VALUES 
('Hello', 'World'),
('Hello', 'MindsDB');
~~~~

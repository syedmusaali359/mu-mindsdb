MindsDB provides the `CREATE CHATBOT` statement that is used under the hood by the [Chatbot Interface](/sql/tutorials/llm-chatbot-ui). But, if you want to customize your chatbot to learn from the underlying database or use a different model, check out this tutorial.

The `CREATE CHATBOT` statement requires the following componenets:

1. **Chat app**: A connection to a chat app, such as [Slack](/integrations/app-integrations/slack) or [MS Teams](/integrations/app-integrations/microsoft-teams).

2. **AI agent**: An AI agent that comes with an AI model trained with the provided training data. Learn more about [AI agents here](/agents/agent).

Learn more about [chatbots here](/agents/chatbot).

Let's go over getting all the components ready.

## Chatbot Components

### Chat App

Here is the command to connect your Slack app to MindsDB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE chatbot_slack
WITH
  ENGINE = 'slack',
  PARAMETERS = {
      "token": "xoxb-...",
      "app_token": "xapp-..."
    };
```

### AI Agent

Start by creating and deploying the model:

```sql
CREATE MODEL conversational_langchain_model
PREDICT answer
USING
  engine = 'langchain',
  mode = 'conversational',
  prompt = 'answer users questions as a helpful assistant',
  user_column = 'question',
  assistant_column = 'answer';
```

Here is the command to check its status:

```sql
DESCRIBE conversational_langchain_model;
```

The status should read `complete` before proceeding.

Create one or more skills for an AI agent:

```sql
CREATE SKILL text_to_sql_skill
USING
    type = 'text_to_sql',
    database = 'example_db',   -- this must be created with CREATE DATABASE
    tables = ['sales_data'];   -- this table comes from example_db
```

This skill enables a model to answer questions about data from the `sales_data` table.

Now let's create an AI agent:

```sql
CREATE AGENT support_agent
USING
model = customer_support_model,  -- this must be created with CREATE MODEL
skills = ['text_to_sql_skill'];  -- this must be created with CREATE SKILL
```

## Create Chatbot

Once all the components are ready, let's proceed to creating the chatbot.

```sql
CREATE CHATBOT my_chatbot
USING
   database = 'chatbot_slack',
   agent = 'support_agent',
   enable_dms = true,
   running = true;
```

The `database` parameter stores connection to a chat app. And the `agent` parameter stores an AI agent created by passing a model and training data.

You can query all chatbot using this query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM chatbots;
```

Now you can go to Slack and chat with the app directly.

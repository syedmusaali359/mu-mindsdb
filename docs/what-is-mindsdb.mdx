MindsDB is an AI Automation platform for building AI/ML powered features and applications. It works by connecting any source of data with any AI/ML model or framework and automating how real-time data flows between them.

MindsDB allows you to easily:

 - Connect to any store of data or end-user application.
 - Pass data to an AI model from any store of data or end-user application.
 - Plug the output of an AI model into any store of data or end-user application.
 - Fully automate these workflows to build AI-powered features and applications.

## Build with MindsDB

As you can connect any data source with any AI/ML model, you can build and automate any AI/ML use case.

Here are some AI/LLM use cases:
      - [Semantic Search and Q&A/RAG](/nlp/question-answering-inside-mysql-with-openai)
      - [Chatbots](/sql/tutorials/twitterbot-mariadb-enterprise-server-skysql)
      - [Classification](/nlp/nlp-extended-examples#text-classification)
      - [Sentiment Analysis](/nlp/sentiment-analysis-inside-mysql-with-openai)
      - [Summarisation](/nlp/text-summarization-inside-mysql-with-openai)
      - [Translation](/nlp/nlp-extended-examples#translation)

You can use MindsDB for the following machine learning use cases:
      - [Forecasting](/sql/tutorials/eeg-forecasting)
      - [Classification](/sql/tutorials/customer-churn)
      - [Regression](/sql/tutorials/home-rentals)
      - Anomaly Detection
      - Recommenders

You can use one of MindsDB’s AutoMLs or you can bring your own, pre-trained model.

## Sample AI Workflow

We can automate any workflow end-to-end using MindsDB’s Jobs command. Take an AI workflow featuring integrations with [Binance](/integrations/app-integrations/binance) (our data source), [TimeGPT](/integrations/ai-engines/timegpt) (our forecasting model), and [Slack](/integrations/app-integrations/slack) (where we’ll publish the outputs from the forecasting model). In this scenario, you can seamlessly retrieve real-time trading data from Binance, utilize it as input for a TimeGPT model to generate forecasts, and receive these forecasts as Slack notifications.

Check out the **Use Cases** section for more examples and tutorials.

## Benefits of MindsDB

1. **Unified AI Deployment and Management**<br></br>
    MindsDB integrates directly with the database, warehouse, or stream. This eliminates the need to build and maintain custom, complex data pipelines or separate systems for AI/ML deployment.

2. **Automated AI Workflows**<br></br>
    MindsDB automates the entire AI workflow to execute on time-based or event-based triggers. No need to build custom automation logic to get predictions, move data, or (re)train models.

3. **Turn every developer into an AI Engineer**<br></br>
    MindsDB enables developers to leverage their existing SQL skills, accelerating the adoption of AI across teams and departments, turning every developer into an AI Engineer.

4. **Enhanced Scalability and Performance**<br></br>
    Whether in your private cloud or using MindsDB’s managed service, MindsDB enables you to handle large-scale AI/ML workloads efficiently. MindsDB can scale to meet the demands of your use case, ensuring optimal performance and responsiveness.

MindsDB provides various data and app handlers that let you connect virtually any data source and make use of your data to finetune models or make predictions. The types of data sources include databases, data lakehouses, data warehouses, and applications.

You can connect a data source to MindsDB with the `CREATE DATABASE` statement by providing connection parameters specific to the data source.

Please note that MindsDB does not store or copy your data. Instead, it utilizes the connection created with the `CREATE DATABASE` statement to access your data when required.

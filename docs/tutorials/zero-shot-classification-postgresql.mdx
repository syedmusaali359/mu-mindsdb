Zero-shot Classification with PostgreSQL and MindsDB
---

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll use [one of the Hugging Face models](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-mnli) to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.

## Data Setup

You can download the [movie review dataset here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).

Upload it to your PostgreSQL database.

## Connecting a Database

Connect your PostgreSQL database to MindsDB by running the below command:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE movie_reviews
WITH ENGINE = 'postgres',    
PARAMETERS = {
	"user": "user_name",        
	"password": "password",        
	"host": "localhost",             
	"port": "5432",
	"database": "database_name"
};
```

Please replace the parameter values, such as host, port, user, password, and database.

Once connected, you can query your data table as below:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM movie_reviews.imdb_reviews;
```

## Training a model

We use the [`CREATE MODEL`](/sql/create/model) statement to bring the Hugging Face models to MindsDB.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.hf_zs_bart
PREDICT PRED
USING
	engine = 'huggingface',
	task = 'zero-shot-classification',
	model_name = 'facebook/bart-large-mnli',
	input_column = 'review',
	candidate_labels = ['positive','negative'];
```

Let's check the model status:

```sql
DESCRIBE hf_zs_bart;
```

Once the status is complete, we can start making predictions.

## Making predictions

### Making a single prediction

Let's start by making a single prediction:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM mindsdb.hf_zs_bart 
WHERE review = 'Average movie';
```

Run it in the MindsDB editor to find out how the model classified this review.

### Making batch predictions

To make batch predictions for all movie reviews from our table, we join the data table with the model.

```sql
SELECT h.PRED, t.sentiment as actual, h.PRED_explain, t.review
FROM imdb_ai_table.imdbreviews AS t
JOIN mindsdb.hf_zs_bart AS h
LIMIT 5;
```

The `actual` column is the actual sentiment of the review which is already available in the dataset.
The `PRED` column is the predicted sentiment value.

Run it in the MindsDB editor to find out the output.

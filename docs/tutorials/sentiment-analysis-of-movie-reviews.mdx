# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews using OpenAI and MongoDB

## Introduction

Good Day Devs! In this tutorial, we are going to analyse the sentiment on movie reviews using OpenAi and MongoDB. we'll use Movie Reviews Dataset from [`Hugging Face`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rotten_tomatoes).

- type of sentiment we are going to analyse for movie review
  - positive
  - neutral
  - negative

## Data Setup

- Download [`MongoDB Compass`](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass) or [`MongoDB Shell`](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell)
- Download the [`Movie reviews`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rotten_tomatoes) dataset
- Run the `MongoDB Compass` or `MongoDB Shell`

## Connecting the Database

- Open the MongoDb Compass Or Shell.
- Connect with URI : `mongodb://cloud.mindsdb.com`.
- If you are using the MongoDB Shell then shell prompt will ask for `login-email` and `password` then hit `Enter` key to connect.
- If you are using the MongoDB Compass then,
  - add `URI` in the URI input area
  - In `Advanced Connection Options` select `Authentication`
  - Then select `Username/Password` ,enter credentials in it and hit `Connect` button.

After connecting with the MindsDB Cloud, let's bring our database using `insertOne` statement,

- `host` : connection string for the mongodb which you can get from `MongoDB Atlas`.

```bash
test> use mindsdb
mindsdb> db.databases.insertOne({
            'name': 'mongo_demo_db',
            'engine': 'mongodb',
            'connection_args': {
                "host": "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster host/ID>.mongodb.net/",
                "database": "public"
            }
        })
```

Here is the output:

```bash
{
  acknowledged: true,
  insertedId: ObjectId("6415a242e60077d8d3548786")
}
```

// By following these steps you're good to go with further steps i.e, analyse the movie review sentiment.

## Understanding the Data

We use the movie reviews dataset, where each row has a movie review and we'll predication whether the review is positive, negative or neutral.

Letâ€™s look at the data stored in the `movie_reviews` table that contains the input columns for the model.

```bash
mindsdb> use mongo_demo_db
mongo_demo_db> db.movie_reviews.find({}).limit(3)
```

Here is the output:

```bash
{
  _id : "64129b66e24d840208b2e498",
  review : "it was good"
},
{
  _id : "64129d44e24d840208b2e49a",
  review : "this is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all ."
},
{
  _id : "64129d64e24d840208b2e49b",
  review : "ultimately , it ponders the reasons we need stories so much ."
}
```

## Training a Predictor

We use the `openai` engine to predict the sentiment of the review.

we can create a model for text sentiment analysis like this:

```bash
mongo_demo_db> use mindsdb
mindsdb> db.models.insertOne({
            name: 'sentiment_classifier_openai',
            predict: 'sentiment',
            training_options: {
                        engine: 'openai',
                        prompt_template: 'describe the sentiment of the reviews strictly as "positive", "neutral", or "negative". "offers that rare combination of entertainment and education":positive "the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie":negative "{{review}}.":'
            }
          })
```

Here is the output:

```bash
{
  acknowledged: true,
  insertedId: ObjectId("6415a242e60077d8d3641099")
}
```

Here, we provided `prompt_template` option with mainly three sentiments, and those are `positive`, `negative` and `neutral`.

## Status of a Predictor

The next step is to check the status of a predictor. Once the above query has started execution, we can check the status of the creation process with the following query:

```bash
mindsdb> db.getCollection('models').find({
            'name': 'sentiment_classifier_openai'
          })
```

It may take a while to register as `complete` depending on the internet connection.

## Making Predictions

### Making a Single Prediction

Once the creation is complete, the behavior is the same as with any other AI table.
Here we are querying by specifying synthetic data in the actual query and the model we created i.e, `sentiment_classifier_openai`:

```bash
mindsdb> db.sentiment_classifier_openai.find({
            review: "it was good"
          })
```

On execution, we get:

```bash
{
  review: "it was good",
  sentiment: "neutral"
}
```

### Making Batch Predictions

Similarly, we can join model with another table for batch predictions with the following query:

```bash
mindsdb> db.sentiment_classifier_openai.find(
            {
                'collection': 'mongo_demo_db.movie_reviews'
            },
            {
                'sentiment_classifier_openai.sentiment': 'sentiment',
                'movie_reviews.review': 'review'
            }
          ).limit(5)
```

On execution, we get:

```bash
{
  review : "it was good",
  sentiment : "neutral"
},
{
  review : "this is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all .",
  sentiment : "positive"
},
{
  review : "ultimately , it ponders the reasons we need stories so much .",
  sentiment : "neutral"
},
{
  review : "everytime you think undercover brother has run out of steam , it finds a new way to surprise and amuse",
  sentiment : "positive"
},
{
  review : "it's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer's face and asks to be seen as hip, winking social commentary.",
  sentiment : "negative"
}
```

The `movie_reviews` table is used to make batch predictions. Upon joining the `sentiment_classifier_openai` model with the `movie_reviews` table, the model uses all values from the `review` column.

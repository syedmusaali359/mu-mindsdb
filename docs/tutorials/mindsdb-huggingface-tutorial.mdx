Text Classification with Hugging Face and MindsDB
---

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll see how to use Hugging Face models in MindsDB to perform NLP tasks, such as text classification.

## Connecting a Database

We use our sample PostgreSQL database. It contains the user_comments table that will be used as input data for the text classification model.

To classify the user comments, we're going to use Hugging Face's [Twitter-roBERTa-base for Sentiment Analysis](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment) model. This Hugging Face transformer is a roBERTa-base model trained on ~58M tweets and fine-tuned for sentiment analysis with the TweetEval benchmark.

Here is how to connect our sample PostgreSQL database to MindsDB:

```
CREATE DATABASE nlp_example
WITH ENGINE = "postgres",
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "demo_user",
    "password": "demo_password",
    "host": "3.220.66.106",
    "port": "5432",
    "database": "demo"
    };
```

Let's query the input table, as below:

```
SELECT * FROM nlp_example.demo_data.user_comments;
```

Check out [Hugging Face's documentation](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment) to explore more transformer models.

## Training a model

Now that we have our data accessible by MindsDB, we're going to create a model .

```
CREATE MODEL nlp_predictor
PREDICT sentiment
USING
  engine = 'huggingface',
  task = 'text-classification',
  model_name = "cardiffnlp/twitter-Roberta-base-sentiment",
  input_column = 'comment',
  labels = ['negative','neutral','positive'];
```

Let's check the training status of our model.

```
DESCRIBE nlp_predictor;
```

Once the status of the model is complete, you can start using it to make predictions.

## Making predictions

Now that our model is ready, we can start using it to classify user comments as positive, neutral, or negative.

Let's start by making a few single predictions where the input comment is provided in the WHERE clause.

Example 1:

```
SELECT * FROM nlp_predictor
WHERE comment = 'It is really hard to do this';
```

Example 2:

```
SELECT * FROM nlp_predictor
WHERE comment = 'I love this world'
```

Example 3:

```sql
SELECT * FROM nlp_predictor
WHERE comment = 'I do not know how I feel about this world'
```

Example 4:

```sql
SELECT * FROM nlp_predictor
WHERE comment = 'I am confused about this'
```

Example 5:

```sql
SELECT * FROM nlp_predictor
WHERE comment = 'I am neutral'
```

Example 6:

```
SELECT * FROM nlp_predictor
WHERE comment = 'I have a nonbiased opinion about that matter, congressman'
```

Example 7:

```sql
SELECT * FROM nlp_predictor
WHERE comment = 'I am impartial to dancing'
```

Run all above examples in the MindsDB editor to find out how the model classified these comments.

Let's look at how to make batch predictions for the user_comments table. Here, the comments are fed to the model one by one, and the model classifies each of them.

```
SELECT *
FROM nlp_predictor AS model
JOIN nlp_example.demo_data.user_comments AS datatable;
```

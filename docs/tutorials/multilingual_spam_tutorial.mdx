Multilingual Spam Data Translation with Hugging Face and MindsDB
---

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use MindsDB and Hugging Face to perform translation tasks on multilingual datasets.

## Data Setup

If you want to follow along, download [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajnathpatel/multilingual-spam-data?resource=download).

It contains multilingual spam data in English, Hindi, German, and French languages. It is primarily used to test the zero-shot transfer for text classification using pre-trained language models. The original data in English was machine-translated into Hindi, German, and French. We'll use this dataset to learn how perform text translation tasks.

Here is how to upload this dataset to MindsDB:

1. Click on "Add" and then "Upload File".
2. Import a file.
3. Provide a name (for example, multilingual_dataset).
4. Click "Save and Continue"

Here is how to preview the data:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM files.multilingual_dataset;
```

## French to English

### Training a model: French to English

Now that you've got some data to work with, it's time to use MindsDB and Hugging Face to perform NLP operations. We'll translate 3 different languages and learn the basics of NLP language translation tasks with MindsDB.

Start by creating a model to translate French to English:

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.hf_fr_en
PREDICT PRED
USING
engine = 'huggingface',
model_name = 'Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-fr-en',
input_column = 'text',
lang_input ='fr',
lang_output = 'en';
```

Check the model status:

```sql
DESCRIBE hf_fr_en;
```

Once the status is complete, it is time to start testing your model.

### Making predictions: French to English

Let's make a couple of single predictions:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mindsdb.hf_fr_en
WHERE text = 'Quelle heure est-il?';
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mindsdb.hf_fr_en
WHERE text = "Je m'appelle Alissa";
```

Run all above examples in the MindsDB editor to find out how the model translates French to English.

## German to English

### Training a model: German to English

We create a model using the [Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-de-en](https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-de-en) Hugging Face model.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.hf_de_en
PREDICT PRED
USING
engine = 'huggingface',
model_name = 'Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-de-en',
input_column = 'text',
lang_input ='de',
lang_output = 'en';
```

Checking the status:

```sql
DESCRIBE hf_de_en;
```

Once the status is complete, it is time to start testing your model.

### Making predictions: German to English

Let's make a couple of single predictions:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hf_de_en
WHERE text = 'Hallo, mein Name ist Alissa';
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hf_de_en
WHERE text = 'Guten Tag, es ist so schön, Sie zu sehen?';
```

Run all above examples in the MindsDB editor to find out how the model translates German to English.

## Hindi (Urdu) to English

### Training a model: Hindi (Urdu) to English

We create a model using the [Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-hi-en](https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-hi-en) Hugging Face model.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.hi_en
PREDICT PRED
USING
engine = 'huggingface',
model_name = 'Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-hi-en',
input_column = 'text_hi',
lang_input ='hi',
lang_output = 'en';
```

Checking the status:

```sql
DESCRIBE hi_en;
```

Once the status is complete, it is time to start testing your model.

### Making predictions: Hindi (Urdu) to English

Let's make a couple of single predictions:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hi_en
WHERE text_hi = 'namaste, aap kaise hain?';
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hi_en
WHERE text_hi = 'मेरा भाई भी मेरे साथ बातें करना नहीं चाहता; वे मेरे साथ सहायक की नाई बर्ताव करते हैं।';
```

Run all above examples in the MindsDB editor to find out how the model translates Hindi (Urdu) to English.

## Making batch predictions

Here is how to make batch predictions by joining the data table with the model:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hf_fr_en AS model
JOIN files.multilingual_dataset AS datatable;
```

## Conclusion

MindsDB's integration with Hugging Face gives you the power to perform Natural Language Processing tasks quickly and easily. In just a few steps, you've already learned how to create Hugging Face transformer models in MindsDB and use them to translate multilingual data into English.

Predicting Salaries with MindsDB
---

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will use the [Employee Earnings Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mukeshmanral/employ-earnings-data) dataset to predict salaries for employees based on their qualifications, industry, and job type.

Make sure you have access to a working MindsDB installation, either locally or at MindsDB Cloud. 

Follow this guide to set up [Mindsdb cloud](https://docs.mindsdb.com/setup/cloud) or set up [locally](https://docs.mindsdb.com/setup/self-hosted/docker).

## Data Setup

### Connecting the Data

Download the [employee dataset here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mukeshmanral/employ-earnings-data?select=batch2_jobID_00B80TR.csv) and upload it by navigating to the Add button located in the top right corner then choose Upload File.

Click on the Import File option to browse through your files and select the CSV file containing the dataset. You can add a suitable name. In this case we wil use jobs.

Let's run a query to preview the data that we will use to train our predictor.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM files.jobs 
LIMIT 10;
```

The query output is shown below.

## Understanding the Data
The dataset has eight columns where seven columns represent properties to be used to predict the employee salary column.

The columns are as follows:

|Column              |Description                       |Data Type |Usage   | 
|---                 |---                               |---       |---     |
|companyId           |Unique identifier for each company|Integer   |Feature | 
|jobType             |Type of employment                |String    |Feature |  
|degree              |Employee's degree                 |String    |Feature | 
|major               |Employee's major                  |String    |Feature |
|industry            |Employee's industry of work       |String    |Feature |
|yearsExperience     |Employee's years of experience    |String    |Feature |
|milesFromMetropolis |Distance from the metropolis      |Integer   |Feature |
|salary              |Employee's salary                 |Integer   |Label   |

A label is a column whose values will be predicted.

A feature is a column used to train the model.

## Training a model

We will use the CREATE MODEL statement to create and train the machine learning model to predict salaries.

We use the FROM statement to specify the input columns to be used for training. We will not use the companyID column because it does not affect the predictor's perfomance.

We specify what we want to predict using the PREDICT statement.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.salary_model
FROM files
(SELECT jobType,degree,major,industry,yearsExperience,milesFromMetropolis,salary FROM files.jobs)
PREDICT salary;
```
### Status of a Predictor

To monitor the status of the predictor use this SQL command:

```sql
DESCRIBE salary_model;
```

Right after creating the predictor, the model shows that it is in the generating phase.
| status     |
|------------|
| generating |

After some time the predictor moves to the training stage.

| status   |
|----------|
| training |

When the model is done training it should show the status as complete and we can now make predictions.
| status   |
|----------|
| complete |

## Making predictions

### Making a single prediction

Let's run the following query to make a single prediction.

```sql
SELECT salary, salary_explain
FROM mindsdb.salary_model
WHERE jobType = 'CFO'
AND degree='MASTERS'
AND major='MATH'
AND industry='HEALTH'
AND yearsExperience=10
AND milesFromMetropolis=83;
```

The output is as shown below.

![Single prediction](..\tutorials\images\salaries_predictions\single_prediction.jpg)

The predictor's performance is quite accurate as the predicted value is 127 while the actual value provided in the dataset is 130. 

The `salary_explain` column provides more details on the predictor's confidence of the values predicted.

### Making batch predictions

To make batch predictions for multiple rows in our dataset, we join the data table with the model using the JOIN statement.

```sql
SELECT  t.salary AS actual_salary,
        m.salary AS predicted_salary,
        t.jobType,t.degree, t.major,t.industry,t.yearsExperience,t.milesFromMetropolis
FROM files.jobs AS t
JOIN mindsdb.salary_model AS m
LIMIT 10;
```

We will limit our predictions to 10 rows.

![Batch predictions](..\tutorials\images\salaries_predictions\batch_predictions.jpg)

The `actual_salary` column is the actual salary of the employee which is already available in the dataset.

The `predicted_salary` column is the value predicted by the model we created.

This is the implementation of the OpenGauss data handler for MindsDB.
  
[OpenGauss](https://opengauss.org/en/) is an open-source relational database management system released with the Mulan PSL v2 and the kernel built on Huawei's years of experience in the database field. It continuously provides competitive features tailored to enterprise-grade scenarios.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented by extending the PostgreSQL data handler.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `user` is the database user.
* `password` is the database password.
* `host` is the host name, IP address, or URL.
* `port` is the port used to make TCP/IP connection.
* `database` is the database name.

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/opengauss_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the OpenGauss database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE opengauss_datasource
WITH
  ENGINE = 'opengauss',
  PARAMETERS = {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 5432,
    "database": "opengauss",
    "user": "mindsdb",
    "password": "password"
  };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM opengauss_datasource.demo_table
LIMIT 10;
```

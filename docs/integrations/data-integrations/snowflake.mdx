This is the implementation of the Snowflake data handler for MindsDB.

[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) is a cloud data warehouse that stores and analyzes data. It can automatically scale up/down its compute resources to load, integrate, and analyze data.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using the Snowflake connector.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `host` is the host name or IP address. The host name comes from the Snowflake link (for example, `uvwxyz123.us-west.gcp.snowflakecomputing.com`).
* `port` is the port used to make TCP/IP connection.
* `database` is the database name. You can find it in the Snowflake dashboard under the Databases tab.
* `user` is the database user.
* `password` is the database password.
* `account` is the Snowflake account. The account name comes from the Snowflake link (for example, `uvwxyz123.us-west.gcp`).
* `schema` is the default schema name used to query the database.
* `protocol` is the protocol that defaults to `https` if left blank.
* `warehouse` is the warehouse account. You can find it in the Snowflake dashboard under the Warehouses tab.

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/snowflake_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the Snowflake database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE snowflake_datasource
WITH
    ENGINE = 'snowflake',
    PARAMETERS = {
    "host": "uvwxyz123.us-west.gcp.snowflakecomputing.com",
    "port": 443,
    "database": "database_name",
    "user": "user",
    "password": "password",
    "account": "uvwxyz123.us-west.gcp",
    "schema": "schema_name",
    "protocol": "https",
    "warehouse": "warehouse_name"
    };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM snowflake_datasource.example_table;
```

Please note that the above query uses the provided schema implicitly so it is equivalent to the following:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM snowflake_datasource.schema_name.example_table;
```

If you have access to other schemas available in the connected Snowflake database, then you can query them as below:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM snowflake_datasource.other_schema_name.example_table;
```

This is the implementation of the Supabase data handler for MindsDB.

[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is an open-source Firebase alternative.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented by extending the PostgreSQL data handler.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `user` is the database user.
* `password` is the database password.
* `host` is the host name, IP address, or URL.
* `port` is the port used to make TCP/IP connection.
* `database` is the database name.

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/supabase_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the Supabase server in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE supabase_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'supabase',
PARAMETERS = {
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 54321,
  "database": "test",
  "user": "supabase",
  "password": "password"
};
```

You can use this established connection to query your database as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM supabase_datasource.public.rentals
LIMIT 10;
```

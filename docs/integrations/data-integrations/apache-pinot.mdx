This is the implementation of the Pinot data handler for MindsDB.

[Apache Pinot](https://pinot.apache.org/) is a real-time distributed OLAP database designed for low-latency query execution even at extremely high throughput. Apache Pinot can ingest directly from streaming sources like Apache Kafka and make events available for querying immediately.

## Implementation

This handler was implemented using the `pinotdb` library, the Python DB-API and SQLAlchemy dialect for Pinot.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `host` is the host name or IP address of the Apache Pinot cluster.
* `broker_port` is the port that the Broker of the Apache Pinot cluster is running on.
* `controller_port` is the port that the Controller of the Apache Pinot cluster is running on.
* `path` is the query path.

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/pinot_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the Pinot cluster in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE pinot_datasource
WITH
    engine = 'pinot',
    parameters = {
      "host":"localhost",
      "broker_port": 8000,
      "controller_port": 9000,
      "path": "/query/sql",
      "scheme": "http"
    };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM pinot_datasource.example_tbl;
```

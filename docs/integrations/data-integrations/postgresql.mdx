This is the implementation of the PostgreSQL data handler for MindsDB.

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) is a powerful, open-source, object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.

## Implementation

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `user` is the database user.
* `password` is the database password.
* `host` is the host name, IP address, or URL.
* `port` is the port used to make TCP/IP connection.
* `database` is the database name.

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/postgres_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the PostgreSQL database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE psql_datasource
WITH
    ENGINE = 'postgres',
    PARAMETERS = {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 5432,
    "database": "postgres",
    "user": "postgres",
    "password": "password"
    };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM psql_datasource.demo_table
LIMIT 10;
```

This is the implementation of the SAP SQL Anywhere data handler for MindsDB.

[SAP SQL Anywhere](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/sql-anywhere.html) is an embedded database for application software that enables secure and reliable data management for servers where no DBA is available and synchronization for tens of thousands of mobile devices, Internet of Things (IoT) systems, and remote environments.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using `sqlanydb`, the Python driver for SAP SQL Anywhere.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `host` is the host name or IP address of the SAP SQL Anywhere instance.
* `port` is the port number of the SAP SQL Anywhere instance.
* `user` specifies the user name.
* `password` specifies the password for the user.
* `database` sets the current database.
* `server` sets the current server.

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/sqlany_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

You can use the below SQL statements to create a table in SAP SQL Anywhere called `TEST`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE TEST
(
    ID          INTEGER NOT NULL,
    NAME        NVARCHAR(1),
    DESCRIPTION NVARCHAR(1)
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX TEST_ID_INDEX
    ON TEST (ID);

ALTER TABLE TEST
    ADD CONSTRAINT TEST_PK
        PRIMARY KEY (ID);

INSERT INTO TEST
VALUES (1, 'h', 'w');
```

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the SAP SQL Anywhere database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE sap_sqlany_trial
WITH
    ENGINE = 'sqlany', 
    PARAMETERS = {
        "user": "DBADMIN",
        "password": "password",
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": "55505",
        "server": "TestMe",
        "database": "MINDSDB"
    };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sap_sqlany_trial.test;
```

On execution, we get:

| ID | NAME | DESCRIPTION |
|----|------|-------------|
| 1  | h    | w           |

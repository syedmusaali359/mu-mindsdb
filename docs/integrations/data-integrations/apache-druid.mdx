This is the implementation of the Druid data handler for MindsDB.

[Apache Druid](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/design) is a real-time analytics database designed for fast slice-and-dice analytics (_OLAP_ queries) on large data sets. Most often, Druid powers use cases where real-time ingestion, fast query performance, and high uptime are important.

## Implementation

This handler was implemented using the `pydruid` library, the Python API for Apache Druid.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `host` is the host name or IP address of the Apache Druid database.
* `port` is the port that Apache Druid is running on.
* `path` is the query path.
* `scheme` is the URI schema. This parameter is optional and defaults to `http`.
* `user` is the username used to authenticate with Apache Druid. This parameter is optional.
* `password` is the password used to authenticate with Apache Druid. This parameter is optional.

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/druid_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to Apache Druid in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE druid_datasource
WITH
    engine = 'druid',
    parameters = {
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": 8888,
      "path": "/druid/v2/sql/",
      "scheme": "http"
    };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM druid_datasource.example_tbl;
```

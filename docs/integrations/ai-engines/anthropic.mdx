In this section, we present how to bring Anthropic models to MindsDB.

[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) is an AI safety and research company based in San Francisco. Their interdisciplinary team has experience across ML, physics, policy, and product. Together, they generate research and create reliable, beneficial AI systems.

Read on to find out how to use Anthropic models within MinsdDB.

## Setup

MindsDB provides the [Anthropic handler](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/tree/staging/mindsdb/integrations/handlers/anthropic_handler) that enables you to create Anthropic models within MindsDB.

### AI Engine

Before creating a model, it is required to create an AI engine based on the provided handler.

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally, make sure to install all Anthropic dependencies by running `pip install .[anthropic]` or from the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/staging/mindsdb/integrations/handlers/anthropic_handler/requirements.txt) file.
</Tip>

You can create an Anthropic engine using this command:

```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE anthropic_engine
FROM anthropic
USING
    api_key = 'your-anthropic-api-key';
```

<Tip>
Please note that you need to provide your Anthropic API key. See Anthropic’s [documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/getting-access-to-claude) on how to get access.
</Tip>

The name of the engine (here, `anthropic_engine`) should be used as a value for the `engine` parameter in the `USING` clause of the `CREATE MODEL` statement.

### AI Model

The [`CREATE MODEL`](/sql/create/model) statement is used to create, train, and deploy models within MindsDB.

```sql
CREATE MODEL anthropic_model
PREDICT answer
USING
    column = 'question',
    engine = 'anthropic_engine',
    api_key = 'your-anthropic-api-key',
    max_tokens = 300,
    model = 'claude-1'; -- choose one of claude-1 or claude-2
```

Where:

| Name              | Description                                                               |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `column`          | It defines the prompt to the model.                                       |
| `engine`          | It defines the Anthropic engine.                                          |
| `api_key`         | It is used to provide your Anthropic API key to gain access to the model. |
| `max_tokens`      | It defines the maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.      |
| `model`           | It defines model that will complete your prompt.                          |

<Info>
**Default Model**
When you create an Anthropic model in MindsDB, it uses the `claude-2` model by default. But you can use the `claude-1` model as well by passing it to the `model` parameter in the `USING` clause of the `CREATE MODEL` statement.
</Info>

<Info>
**Default Max Tokens**
When you create an Anthropic model in MindsDB, it uses 100 tokens as the maximum by default. But you can adjust this value by passing it to the `max_tokens` parameter in the `USING` clause of the `CREATE MODEL` statement.
</Info>

## Usage

Once you have created an Anthropic model, you can use it to make predictions.

```sql
SELECT question, answer
FROM mindsdb.anthropic_model
WHERE question = 'Where is Stockholm located?';
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| question                    | completion                                                                                                                                                                 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Where is Stockholm located? |  Stockholm is the capital and largest city of Sweden. It is located on Sweden's south-central east coast, where Lake Mälaren meets the Baltic Sea.                         |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

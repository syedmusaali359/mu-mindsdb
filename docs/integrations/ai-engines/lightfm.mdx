The [LightFM](https://github.com/lyst/lightfm) handler is built as an interface and the LightFM python recommendation library. The current implementation supports collaborative filtering for user-item and item-item recommendations. It allows users to make use of the powerful LightFM recommendation framework library for performing recommendation on interaction data sets.

As the current implementations stand, the input data should be a table containing user-item interaction data:

```
+---------+---------+--------+
| user_id | item_id | rating |
+---------+---------+--------+
| 1       | 2       | 4      |
| 1       | 3       | 7      |
+---------+---------+--------+
```

<Note>
Please note that at the moment this integrations does not support the `FINETUNE` feature.

## Example

Before creating a LightFM model, we need to create an ML engine.

```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE lightfm
FROM lightfm;
```

You can verify it by running `SHOW ML_ENGINES`.

Now let's create a LightFM model specifying the necessary input parameters.

```sql
CREATE MODEL lightfm_demo
FROM mysql_demo_db (SELECT * FROM movie_lens_ratings)
PREDICT movieId
USING
  engine = 'lightfm',
  item_id = 'movieId',
  user_id = 'userId',
  threshold = 4,
  n_recommendations = 10,
  evaluation = true;
```

The required parameters include the following:

- The `item_id` parameter that stores items to be recommended; here, these are movies.
- The `user_id` parameter that stores users to whom items are recommended.
- The `threshold` parameter is used when score of interaction is provided in the input data. It defines the threshold for the recommendation.
- The `n_recommendations` parameter stores the number of recommendations to be returned.

Optionally, you can provide the `evaluation` parameter if you want to store the evaluation metrics. It is set to `false` by default.

<Tip>
Here is how to connect the `mysql_demo_db` used for training the model:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mysql_demo_db
WITH ENGINE = 'mysql',
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "user",
    "password": "MindsDBUser123!",
    "host": "db-demo-data.cwoyhfn6bzs0.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
    "port": "3306",
    "database": "public"
};
```
</Tip>

Let's query for the following recommendations:

- Get recommendations for all item_item pairs:

    ```sql
    SELECT b.*
    FROM lightfm_demo AS b
    WHERE recommender_type = 'item_item';
    ```

- Get item-item recommendations for a specific item_id:

    ```sql
    SELECT b.*
    FROM lightfm_demo AS b
    WHERE movieId = 100
    USING recommender_type = 'item_item';
    ```

- Get recommendations for all user-item pairs:

    ```sql
    SELECT b.*
    FROM lightfm_demo AS b
    where recommender_type = 'user_item';
    ```

- Get user-item recommendations for a specific user_id:

    ```sql
    SELECT b.*
    FROM lightfm_demo AS b
    WHERE userId = 100
    USING recommender_type = 'user_item';
    ```

- Get user-item recommendations for multiple user_ids:

    ```sql
    SELECT b.*
    FROM mysql_demo_db.movie_lens_ratings AS a
    JOIN lightfm_demo AS b
    WHERE a.userId in (215,216);
    ```

In this section, we present how to bring Cohere models to MindsDB.

[Cohere](https://cohere.com/) offers world-class generative models and industry-best retrieval capabilities, which is the key combination to unlocking Generative AI value for the enterprise.

Read on to find out how to use Cohere models within MinsdDB. 

## Setup

MindsDB provides the [Cohere handler](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/tree/staging/mindsdb/integrations/handlers/cohere_handler) that enables you to create Cohere models within MindsDB.

### AI Engine

Before creating a model, it is required to create an AI engine based on the provided handler.

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally, make sure to install all Cohere dependencies by running `pip install .[cohere]` or from the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/staging/mindsdb/integrations/handlers/cohere_handler/requirements.txt) file.
</Tip>

You can create an Cohere engine using this command:

```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE cohere_engine
FROM cohere
USING
    api_key = 'your-cohere-api-key';
```

<Tip>
Please note that you need to provide your Cohere API key. Once you sign up for a Cohere account, an API key can be requested from the Cohere dashboard. Learn more [here](https://cohere.com/pricing).
</Tip>

The name of the engine (here, `cohere_engine`) should be used as a value for the `engine` parameter in the `USING` clause of the `CREATE MODEL` statement.

### AI Model

The [`CREATE MODEL`](/sql/create/model) statement is used to create, train, and deploy models within MindsDB.

```sql
CREATE MODEL cohere_model
PREDICT language
USING
    task = 'language-detection',
    column = 'text',
    engine = 'cohere_engine'
```

Where:

| Name              | Description                                                            |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `task`            | It defines the task to be accomplished.                                |
| `column`          | It defines the column with the text to be acted upon.                  |
| `engine`          | It defines the Cohere engine.                                          |
| `api_key`         | It is used to provide your Cohere API key to gain access to the model. |

## Usage

Once you have created an Cohere model, you can use it to make predictions.

```sql
SELECT text, language
FROM mindsdb.cohere_model
WHERE question = 'Здравствуй, Мир';
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+----------------------------+
| text            | language |
+----------------------------+
| Здравствуй, Мир |  Russian |
+----------------------------+
```

## Supported Tasks

The following tasks are supported by the Cohere handler:
* `language-detection`: detect the language of a given text.
* `text-generation`: generate text based on a given prompt.
* `text-summarization`: summarize a given text.

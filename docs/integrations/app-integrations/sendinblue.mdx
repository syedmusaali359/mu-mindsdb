In this section, we present how to connect Sendinblue to MindsDB.

[Brevo (formerly Sendinblue)](https://www.brevo.com/) is an all-in-one platform to automate your marketing campaigns over Email, SMS, WhatsApp or chat.

Data from Sendinblue can be used to understand the impact of email marketing.

## Connection

This handler is implemented using the [sib-api-v3-sdk](https://github.com/sendinblue/APIv3-python-library) library, a Python library that wraps Sendinblue APIs.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `api_key`: a required Sendinblue API key to use for authentication

<Tip>
Check out [this guide](https://developers.brevo.com/docs) on how to create the Sendinblue API key.

It is recommended to use the API key to avoid the `API rate limit exceeded` error.
</Tip>

Here is how to connect the SendinBlue to MindsDB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE sib_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'sendinblue',
PARAMETERS = {
  "api_key": "xkeysib-..."
};
```

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/sendinblue_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

Use the established connection to query your database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sib_datasource.email_campaigns
```

Run more advanced queries:

```sql
SELECT  id, name
FROM sib_datasource.email_campaigns
WHERE status = 'sent'
ORDER BY name
LIMIT 5
```

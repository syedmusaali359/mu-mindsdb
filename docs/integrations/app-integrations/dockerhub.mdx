In this section, we present how to connect Docker Hub repository to MindsDB.

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is the world's easiest way to create, manage, and deliver your team's container applications.

Data from Docker Hub can be utilized within MindsDB to train models and make predictions about Docker Hub repositories.

## Connection

This handler is implemented using the `requests` library that makes http calls to https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/api/latest/#tag/resources.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `username`: Username used to login to DockerHub.
* `password`: Password used to login to DockerHub.

<Tip>
Read about creating an account [here](https://hub.docker.com/).

Here is how to connect to Docker Hub using MindsDB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE dockerhub_datasouce
WITH ENGINE = 'dockerhub',
PARAMETERS = {
  "username": "username",
  "password": "password"
};
```

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/dockerhub_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

Now, you can query Docker Hub as follows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM dockerhub_datasouce.repo_images_summary WHERE namespace="docker" AND repository="trusted-registry-nginx";
```

<Tip>
Both the `namespace` and `repository` parameters are required in the WHERE clause.

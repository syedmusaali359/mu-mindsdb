In this section, we present how to connect YouTube to MindsDB.

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) is a popular online video-sharing platform and social media website where users can upload, view, share, and interact with videos created by individuals and organizations from around the world.

Data from YouTube can be utilized within MindsDB to train AI models and chatbots based on user comments, detect sentiment of comments, or use AI models to create replies.

## Connection

This handler is implemented using the `google-api-python-client` library, a Python library that from where we can use YouTube v3 API.

The only required argument to establish a connection are as follows:

* `youtube_api_token` which is a Google API key used for authentication.

<Tip>
Check out [this guide](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-to-get-youtube-api-key) on how to create the API key in order to access YouTube data.
</Tip>

The first step is to create a database with the new `Youtube` engine using the following command:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mindsdb_youtube
WITH ENGINE = 'youtube',
PARAMETERS = {
  "youtube_api_token": "<your-youtube-api-key-token>"  
};
```

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/youtube_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

Use the established connection to query the `get_comments` table for any YouTube Video of your choice.

```sql
SELECT * FROM mindsdb_youtube.get_comments
WHERE youtube_video_id = "raWFGQ20OfA";
```


Advanced queries which are supported

```sql
SELECT * FROM mindsdb_youtube.get_comments
WHERE youtube_video_id = "raWFGQ20OfA"
ORDER BY display_name ASC
LIMIT 5;
```

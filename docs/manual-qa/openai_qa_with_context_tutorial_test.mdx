1. Testing CREATE MODEL
```sql
CREATE MODEL project_a.openai_test_b
PREDICT answer
USING
    engine = 'openai',
    question_column = 'question',
    context_column = 'context';
```

| NAME | ENGINE | PROJECT | ACTIVE | VERSION | STATUS | ACCURACY | PREDICT | UPDATE_STATUS | MINDSDB_VERSION | ERROR | SELECT_DATA_QUERY | TRAINING_OPTIONS | TAG |
| ---- | ------ | ------- | ------ | ------- | ------ | -------- | ------- | ------------- | --------------- | ----- | ----------------- | ---------------- | --- |

Testing SELECT (making predictions)

```sql
SELECT context, question, answer
FROM project_a.openai_test_b
WHERE context = 'Answer with a joke'
AND question = 'How to cook soup?';


```

Output:

| context | question | answer |
| ------- | -------- | ------ |
| Answer with a joke | How to cook soup? | Well, first you need to find a pot that's big enough to hold all the ingredients. Then you add some water, some vegetables, and some meat. Finally, you turn up the heat and wait until the vegetables are tender. And voila! You have a pot of hot water with some soggy vegetables and meat floating in it. Just kidding, that's not soup. But seriously, follow a recipe. |

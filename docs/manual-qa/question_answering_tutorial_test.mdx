## Testing: Question Answering Tutorial

Testing CREATE DATABASE
```sql
CREATE DATABASE mysql_demo_db
WITH ENGINE = 'mysql',
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "user",
    "password": "MindsDBUser123!",
    "host": "db-demo-data.cwoyhfn6bzs0.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
    "port": "3306",
    "database": "public"
};

SELECT *
FROM mysql_demo_db.questions
LIMIT 3;

```
Output:
```sql
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+-------------+
| article_title    | question                                               | true_answer |

Testing CREATE MODEL
```sql
CREATE MODEL question_answering_model
PREDICT answer
USING
    engine = 'openai',
    prompt_template = 'answer the question of text:{{question}} about text:{{article_title}}';

SELECT * FROM models
WHERE name = 'question_answering_model';

SELECT article_title, question, answer
FROM question_answering_model
WHERE question = 'Was Abraham Lincoln the sixteenth President of the United States?'
AND article_title = 'Abraham_Lincoln';

```
Output:

## Testing: Text Summarization Tutorial

1. Testing CREATE DATABASE

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mysql_demo_db
WITH ENGINE = 'mysql',
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "user",
    "password": "MindsDBUser123!",
    "host": "db-demo-data.cwoyhfn6bzs0.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
    "port": "3306",
    "database": "public"
};

```
Output:

```sql
Query successfully completed
```


2. Testing CREATE MODEL

```sql
CREATE MODEL text_summarization_model
PREDICT highlights
USING
    engine = 'openai',              
    prompt_template = 'provide an informative summary of the text text:{{article}} using full sentences';

```

3. Testing SELECT (making predictions)
```sql
SELECT article, highlights
FROM text_summarization_model
WHERE article = "Apple's Watch hits stores this Friday when customers and employees
                alike will be able to pre-order the timepiece. And boss Tim Cook is
                rewarding his staff by offering them a 50 per cent discount on the device.";

With MindsDB, you can create and deploy AI agents that comprise AI models and customizable skills such as knowledge bases and text-to-SQL.

AI agents use a conversational model (like OpenAI or Anthropic) from LangChain utilizing [tools as skills](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/tools/) to respond to user input. Users can customize AI agents with their own prompts to fit their use cases.

A [chatbot](/agents/chatbot) can be thought of as an agent connected to some messaging interface.

## How to work with AI agents

### Create skills

Start by setting up the skills. You can create and manage skills using MindsDB SQL or via REST API endpoints.

#### MindsDB SQL

Here is how to create, update, and delete skills and knowledge bases using MindsDB SQL:

* Creating, inserting into, updating, and deleting a knowledge base:

    ```sql
    CREATE KNOWLEDGE BASE my_knowledge_base
    USING
        model = model_name, -- this must be an embedding model created with CREATE MODEL (see examples below)
        storage = vector_database.storage_table; -- this parameter is optional; if not provided, the default ChromaDB is used for storage

    -- inserts new data rows and generates id for each row if id is not provided
    INSERT INTO my_knowledge_base
        SELECT text AS content FROM datasource.data_table;

    -- inserts new data rows and updates existing ones if id value matches
    INSERT INTO my_knowledge_base
        SELECT id, text AS content FROM datasource.data_table;

    -- view content of a knowledge base (for example, to look up the generated id values)
    SELECT * FROM my_knowledge_base;

    DROP KNOWLEDGE BASE my_knowledge_base;
    ```

* Creating, updating, and deleting a skill that utilizes a knowledge base:

    ```sql
    CREATE SKILL kb_skill
    USING
        type = 'knowledge_base',
        source = 'my_knowledge_base', -- this must be created with CREATE KNOWLEDGE BASE
        description = 'My data'; -- data description to help the agent know when to use the knowledge base

    UPDATE SKILL kb_skill
    SET
       source = 'new_knowledge_base'; -- this must be created with CREATE KNOWLEDGE BASE

    DROP SKILL kb_skill;
    ```

* Creating, updating, and deleting a text-to-SQL skill:

    ```sql
    CREATE SKILL text_to_sql_skill
    USING
        type = 'text_to_sql',
        database = 'example_db', -- this must be created with CREATE DATABASE
        tables = ['sales_data'];

    UPDATE SKILL text_to_sql_skill
    SET
        database = 'new_example_db', -- this must be created with CREATE DATABASE
        tables = ['sales_data'];

    DROP SKILL text_to_sql_skill;
    ```

You can query all skills using this command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM skills;
```

#### REST API

Here is how to interact with skills using REST API endpoints:

* `GET /projects/<project_name>/skills` - gets all skills created by the user (allow params to filter by agent)
* `GET /projects/<project_name>/skills/<skill_name>` - gets a skill by name or ID
* `PUT /projects/<project_name>/skills/<skill_name>` - updates skill with new params
* `POST /projects/<project_name>/skills` - creates a new skill
* `DELETE /projects/<project_name>/skills/<skills>` - deletes a skill by name or ID

### Create an agent

An agent can be created, deleted, queried, and updated using MindsDB SQL or via REST API endpoints.

#### MindsDB SQL

Here is how to interact with agents using MindsDB SQL:

* Creating an AI agent:

    ```sql
    CREATE AGENT my_agent
    USING
       model = 'chatbot_agent', -- this must be created with CREATE MODEL
       skills = ['test_skill']; -- this must be created with CREATE SKILL
    ```

* Updating an AI agent:

    ```sql
    UPDATE AGENT my_agent
    SET
       model = 'new_chatbot_agent', -- this must be created with CREATE MODEL
       skills_to_remove = ['test_skill'],
       skills_to_add = ['production_skill']; -- this must be created with CREATE SKILL
    ```

* Deleting an AI agent:

    ```sql
    DROP AGENT my_agent;
    ```

You can query all agents using this command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM agents;
```

#### REST API

Here is how to interact with agents using REST API endpoints:

* `GET /projects/<project_name>/agents` - gets all agents created by the user
* `GET /projects/<project_name>/agents/<agent>` - gets an agent by name or ID
* `PUT /projects/<project_name>/agents/<agent_name>` updates agent with new settings
* `POST /projects/<project_name>/agents` - creates a new agent
* `DELETE /projects/<project_name>/agent/<agent_name>` - deletes an agent by name or ID

## Example

### Agents with Text-to-SQL Skills

Start by creating a conversational large language model to be used by an agent.

```sql
CREATE MODEL my_model
PREDICT answer
USING
    engine = 'langchain',
    input_column = 'question',
    api_key = 'your-model-api-key', -- choose one of OpenAI or Anthropic
    model_name='gpt-4', -- optional model name from OpenAI or Anthropic
    mode = 'conversational',
    user_column = 'question' ,
    assistant_column = 'answer',
    max_tokens=100,
    temperature=0,
    verbose=True,
    prompt_template='Answer the user input in a helpful way';
```

<Tip>
Follow the integration doc pages for [LangChain](/integrations/ai-engines/langchain) and [OpenAI](/integrations/ai-engines/openai).
</Tip>

Then, connect a data source to be used for creating a skill.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE example_db
WITH ENGINE = "postgres",
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "demo_user",
    "password": "demo_password",
    "host": "3.220.66.106",
    "port": "5432",
    "database": "demo"
    };
 
SELECT * FROM example_db.sales_data;
```

Create a skill using one or more tables from a connected data source.

```sql
CREATE SKILL text_to_sql_skill
USING
    type = 'text_to_sql',
    database = 'example_db',
    tables = ['sales_data'];
```

Now that we have a model and a skill, let's create an agent.

```sql
CREATE AGENT text_to_sql_agent
USING
    model = 'my_model',
    skills = ['text_to_sql_skill'];
```

The next step would be to connect a chat app, like Slack, to MindsDB and create a chatbot utilizing this agent.

### Agents with Knowledge Bases as Skills

To create a knowledge base, it is required to provide an embedding model. You can choose one from OpenAI, Hugging Face, or LangChain.

```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE openai_engine
FROM openai
USING
   api_key = 'your-openai-api-key';

CREATE MODEL embedding_model
PREDICT embeddings
USING
   engine = 'openai_engine',
   mode='embedding',
   model_name='text-embedding-ada-002',
   question_column = 'content';
```

Now let's create a knowledge base that uses this embedding model and the default storage vector database (that is, ChromaDB).

```sql
CREATE KNOWLEDGE BASE my_knowledge_base
USING
   model = embedding_model;
```

This is how you can insert data into the knowledge base and select it.

```sql
INSERT INTO my_knowledge_base (content)
VALUES ('I drink tea.');

SELECT * FROM my_knowledge_base;
```

Use this knowledge base to create a skill for an agent:

```sql
CREATE SKILL kb_skill
USING
    type = 'knowledge_base',
    source = 'my_knowledge_base', -- this must be created with CREATE KNOWLEDGE BASE
    description = 'My data'; -- data description to help the agent know when to use the knowledge base
```

MindsDB empowers organizations to harness the power of AI by abstracting AI models as Generative AI Tables. These tables are capable of learning from the input data and generating predictions from the underlying model upon being queried. This abstraction makes AI highly accessible, enabling development teams to use their existing SQL skills to build applications powered by AI.

## What are Generative AI Tables?

Generative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence that trains AI models to create new content, such as realistic text, forecasts, images, and more, by learning patterns from existing data.

MindsDB revolutionizes machine learning within enterprise databases by introducing the concept of **Generative AI tables**. These essentially represent AI models as virtual database tables, capable of producing realistic outputs given certain inputs.

```sql
-- Example of querying an AI table
-- This AI table is trained to generate customer support responses.

SELECT 
  response   -- AI generated output 
FROM 
  ai_response_model  -- A generative AI model as a virtual table
WHERE 
  customer_message = "Dear Team, I spilled water on the computer I bought on June 1st 2024, order #3418276, and it is no longer working, what should I do?"
```

Generative AI Tables streamline the process of making predictions based on your data, thereby allowing developers to tap into the comprehensive ecosystem of state-of-the-art Generative AI using simple SQL statements.

To better understand this concept, let’s have a deeper exploration in the use case of generating automated responses to emails coming from customers. 

First let's look at the data that we have. In this case, imagine that you have a table with incoming emails.

```sql
SELECT message_id, customer_message
FROM postgres_demo_db.customer_messages;
```

On execution, we get:

``` csv
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| message_id | customer_message                                                                                                                                  |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1          | "I've been having trouble with my product; it's not working as it should. I would like to request a return. My order number is 12345."            |
| 2          | "My account settings won't update no matter what I try. Can you help?"                                                                            |
| 3          | "My product stopped working after just a week of use. I didn't expect this from your brand. Can I get a refund?"                                  |
| 4          | "I suspect my account has been hacked. I noticed some unusual activity. Please assist me in securing it."                                         |
| 5          | "There seems to be an issue with the settings on my account, they're not saving correctly."                                                       |
| 6          | "I believe my account has been compromised. Please help me regain control and secure my account."                                                 |
| 7          | "I'm not satisfied with the product I received. It's not working as advertised. I'd like to return it, please. My order number is 56789."         |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## Creating a Generative AI-Table

We can for example create an OpenAI model that will generate a *response* given some *prompt_template* instructions written in plain English.

```sql
CREATE MODEL ai_response_model
PREDICT response
USING
    engine = ‘openai’,
    prompt_template = '

Generate a simple customer response depending on the following options:

- If it is a message about returns and there is an order number, the message should be as follows (populate order_id in the URL accordingly):
"We are sorry about the issues with your product. Please follow this link to process your return: http://website.com/returns?order_id=<order_id>."
- If the message is about returns but has no order number, respond by asking for the order number and provide a link to see the list of their orders: http://website.com/my_orders.
- If the message is about the account being compromised, send them a link to immediately change their password: http://website.com/change_password.
- Otherwise, simply respond with [NEEDS_ATTENTION].

	The message is the following: {customer_message}
';
```

Now that we generated our AI Table, we can query for messages and their generated responses using **JOIN**s.

```sql
SELECT i.message_id,  m.response, i.customer_message
FROM postgres_demo_db.customer_messages AS i
JOIN ai_response_model AS m;
```

Results in:

```csv
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| i.message_id | m.response                                                                                                                                | i.customer_message                                                                                                                     |

## Difference between AI Tables and Standard Tables

To understand the difference, we can go over a much simpler example, here we will see how traditional database tables are designed to give you a deterministic response given some input, and Generative AI Tables are designed to generate an approximate response given some input.

Let’s consider the following `income_table` table that stores the `income` and `debt` values.

```sql
SELECT income, debt
FROM income_table;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+------+-----+
|income|debt |
+------+-----+
|60000 |20000|
|80000 |25100|
|100000|30040|
|120000|36010|
+------+-----+
```

A simple visualization of the data present in the `income_table` table is as
follows:

![Income vs Debt](/assets/sql/income_vs_debt.png)

Querying the income table to get the `debt` value for a particular `income`
value results in the following:

```sql
SELECT income, debt
FROM income_table
WHERE income = 80000;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+------+-----+
|income|debt |
+------+-----+
|80000 |25100|
+------+-----+
```

And here is what we get:

![Income vs Debt chart](/assets/sql/income_vs_debt_known_value.png)

But what happens when querying the table for an `income` value that is not
present there?

```sql
SELECT income, debt
FROM income_table
WHERE income = 90000;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

When the `WHERE` clause condition is not fulfilled for any of the rows, no
value is returned.

![Income vs Debt query](/assets/sql/income_vs_debt_unknown_value.png)

When a table doesn’t have an exact match, the query returns an empty set or null
value. This is where the AI Tables come into play!

Let’s create a `debt_model` model that allows us to approximate the `debt` value
for any `income` value. We train the `debt_model` model using the data from the
`income_table` table.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.debt_model
FROM income_table
PREDICT debt;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (x.xxx sec)
```

MindsDB provides the [`CREATE MODEL`](/sql/create/model/) statement. On execution of this statement, the predictive model works in the background, automatically creating a vector representation of the data that can be visualized as follows:

![Income vs Debt model](/assets/sql/income_vs_debt_predictor.png)

Let’s now look for the `debt` value of some random `income` value. To get the approximated `debt` value, we query the `mindsdb.debt_model` model instead of the `income_table` table.

```sql
SELECT income, debt
FROM mindsdb.debt_model
WHERE income = 90000;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+------+-----+
|income|debt |
+------+-----+
|90000 |27820|
+------+-----+
```

And here is how it looks:

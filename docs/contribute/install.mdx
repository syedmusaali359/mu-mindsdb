If you want to contribute to the development of MindsDB, you need to install
it first.

There are a few installation options that you can choose as follows:

- from [source](/setup/self-hosted/pip/source/),
- using PyPi for [Windows](/setup/self-hosted/pip/windows/),
  [Linux](/setup/self-hosted/pip/linux/), or
  [MacOS](/setup/self-hosted/pip/macos/),
- using [Docker image](/setup/self-hosted/docker/).

Our preferred MindsDB installation method for development is the installation
from source.

## Installing MindsDB

Here, we recall the steps of MindsDB installation from source. You can either
follow the steps below or visit the provided link.

Before proceeding, make sure you have `Git` and `Python 3.8.x` or `Python 3.9.x`
installed.

1. Fork the MindsDB repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/fork).

2. Clone the fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb.git
   ```

3. Create a new virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv mindsdb-venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source mindsdb-venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install MindsDB with its local development dependencies and start it:

   Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd mindsdb
   pip install -e .
   pip install -r requirements/requirements-dev.txt
   ```
   
   And start MindsDB:
   
   ```bash
   python -m mindsdb
   ```
   
   <Tip>
   Alternatively, you can use a makefile to install dependencies and start MindsDB:
  
    ```bash
    make install_mindsdb
    make run_mindsdb
    ```
   </Tip>

By default, MindsDB will always start the `http` and `mysql` APIs. If you want to use Mongo API, you will need to provide that as a parameter to `--api`. You can do it as follows:

   ```bash
   python -m mindsdb --api=http,mongodb,mysql
   ```

If everything works as expected, you should see the following message in the console:

```
...

mindsdb.api.http.initialize:  - GUI available at http://127.0.0.1:47334/
mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.mysql_proxy: Starting MindsDB Mysql proxy server on tcp://127.0.0.1:47335
mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.mysql_proxy: Waiting for incoming connections...
mindsdb: mysql API: started on 47335
mindsdb: http API: started on 47334
```

You can access the MindsDB Editor at `localhost:47334`.

## Dependencies

The dependencies for many of the data or ML integrations are not installed by default.

If you want to use a data or ML integration whose dependencies are not available by default, install it by running this command:

```
pip install .[handler_name]
```

<Tip>
You can find all available [handlers here](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/tree/staging/mindsdb/integrations/handlers).

## What's Next?

Now that you are all set, we recommend you check out our **Tutorials** and
**Community Tutorials** sections, where you'll find various examples of
regression, classification, and time series predictions with MindsDB.

To learn more about MindsDB itself, follow the guide on
[MindsDB database structure](/sql/table-structure/). Also, don't miss out on the
remaining pages from the **SQL API** section, as they explain a common SQL
syntax with examples.

Have fun!
